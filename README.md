# My android tools

This is a set of tools for Android development in the Mac/Linux labs at Teesside
uni. The point is to be able to install something even if it is temporary on the
local hard drive instead of relying on the installed versions from the lab
image.

Some of those scripts can apply to the Mac labs:

    androidSetup.command
    androidSetup.sh: installs an Android Virtual Device for Android 2.2
    clean.command: removes the AVD

Some other apply to the Linux labs:

    getplatform.sh: used to obtain an api level from Google.
    install_platform.sh n: this uses the previous to install api level n.
